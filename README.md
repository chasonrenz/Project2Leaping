Project 2: Requirements
Introduction
Welcome to Project 2, and congratulations on making it this far! For this project, we're going to be focusing on code quality, using things like Javascript linting and continuous integration (via TravisCI). These tools will be introduced in class on project kickoff day. A few things to note:

You can choose your own group to work with if you'd like
Each group should create one repository, and add all members as collaborators
Each group must submit their proposal by the end of class on Saturday, October 24th, 2020. There will be ample time during this class to brainstorm, etc. We will also be dedicating some time to getting the repo set up with the new tools!
